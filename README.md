# Tanuki

## Preparation

Source code in `server/src/worker.ts` should automatically detect underlying OS and choose suitable name of compiler binary (`./compile < input > output` for Linux, `compile.exe < input > output` for Windows). You only need to make sure that you have binary compiled on your platform in `server\` folder. You can compile it from source from link below.
